"Yes, I like knives";

IF not done on your laptop and done on campus mac, you prob need to store them in your 'goinfre' file;
**groot:** _a person given to excess in the consumption of food and drink. A greedy or ravenous eater; a glutton._

- The goinfre file is kinda like a cloud that can store lots of files with large GB, your mac by now should have 1GB to 3GB which isn't enough.

  **STORAGE**
- Virtualbox Disk Image (VDI): Oracle VM VirtualBox uses its own container format for guest hard disks.
- Virtual Hard Disk (VHD): disk image file formats that have similar functionalities to a physical hard drive and are designed primarily for use with Hyper-V virtual machines.
- Virtual Machine Disk (VMDK): a disk image file format for storing the entire contents of a computer's hard drive.
\\
- Dynamically allocated memory: use space on the physical hard disk as more things are added and will not shrink if space is freed
- Fixed size: faster to use but slower for sys to create.

  **PARTITION**
- a logical division of a hard disk that is treated as a separate unit by operating systems (OSes) and file systems.
- more logical than functional
- splitting the drive up into specific segmented parts
- LOGICAL VOLUME MANAGEMENT (LVM)
  - a portion of physical volume, a hierarchy of structures is used to manage disk storage
  - every phy vol belongs to a volume grp OR used directly for virtual storage
